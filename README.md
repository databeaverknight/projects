# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my Data Analysis Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects where I explore, analyze, and visualize data using a variety of tools including Python, R, and SQL.

## Overview

This repository is a showcase of my journey through data analysis, featuring projects that range from beginner-friendly explorations to more advanced analyses. Each project folder contains all the necessary files, including datasets, scripts, to understand and replicate the analysis.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Key libraries include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
- **R**: Employed for statistical analysis and data visualization, leveraging packages such as ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr.
- **SQL**: Used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, working with databases to query and manipulate data.
